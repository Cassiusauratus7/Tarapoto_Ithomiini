Requires Simon Martin's scripts, found at https://github.com/simonhmartin/genomics_general. My scripts assume that they've been installed in /software/team347/${USERNAME}
These scripts use Brevioleria and Napeogenes sample IDs as examples, change the sample names as needed
Requires numpy, which can be installed via conda. Remember to conda activate numpy before running
These are submitted as job arrays, (e.g. ABBA[1-19]), make sure the number of jobs corresponds to the number of files processed
